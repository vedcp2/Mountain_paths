This application processes elevation data from a file and generates a PPM (Portable Pixmap) file depicting the shortest path across the terrain. This PPM file can subsequently be transformed into a JPEG format for easier viewing of the paths.

The user inputs include the dimensions of the image (specified first by rows and then by columns, in pixels) and the name of the data file.

In the produced image, paths are color-coded for clarity: the red line indicates the shortest path from the chosen starting point, while the green line represents the absolute shortest path across the landscape.
